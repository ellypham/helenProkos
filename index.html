				<p>I’ve been nicknamed ‘The Fixer’. I think that’s due in large part to my keen ability to see the big picture, take action and come up with strategic solutions that work. And all of this, under extremely tight timelines and budgets. Dungeon Siege II, The BP Ultimate Road Tour and MSN World Tour were all literally ‘turned around’ in 48 hours under my leadership and the latter of the two have been rolled out nationally across the US and globally, respectively. All of which has helped me to earn the respect of my colleagues and clients.</p>
			
				<p>I’ve enjoyed many firsts including the first integrated program for Robinhood (Aurora Foods) which included their first website and their first DRTV spot that won a Gold RSVP. I also created the first website for Duncan Hines, Dubble Bubble and Nestle Foodservices.</p>

				<p>nestlefoodservice.com was such a tremendous success the client decided to roll it out globally including markets such as the US, Malaysia, Germany, England, Switzerland – just to name a few. I also recently created an Integrated Migration Strategy (yes, I’m part account person) for Kraft Foodservices.</p>
			
				<p>I approach every project, no matter how big or small in scope or budget – strategically. I believe that strategy is the cornerstone of smart conceptual work. Or at least the kind of work that wins awards and gets recognized.</p>
			
				<p>The best part? I can’t imagine doing anything else.</p>

			<h2>XBOX Gid</h2>
			<h3>Viral Game</h3>

			<h4>The Challenge</h4>
			<p>To gain greater insight into the Gamer Profile</p>

			<h4>The Insight</h4>
			<p>Every gamer is unique. Every gamer has a handle that identifies them in the online or ‘LIVE’ world of games.</p>

			<h4>Target</h4>
			<p>Online Games</p>

			<h4>The Concept</h4>
			<p>GiD - Gamer Identification Tag</p>

			<h4>The Solution</h4>
			<p>A deeply engaging, viral experience that recognizes and rewards Gamers for creating their profile. As unique as their DNA, the GiD tells the world what type of gamer the are. The viral component enables the gamer to email the site to friends so that they can enjoy the same experience. Gamers who created a GiD were able to personalize it by using the painting tool application.

			To thank gamers for creating their GiD, they were encouraged to request free stickers of their GiD, turn their GiD into wallpaper or into an MSN Buddy Icon.</p>

			<h2>XBOX Livin' It</h2>
			<h3>Viral Game</h3>

			<h4>The Challenge</h4>
			<p>To create excitement around the launch of the XBOX 360 console</p>

			<h4>Target</h4>
			<p>Online Games</p>

			<h4>The Insight</h4>
			<p>Gamers are into everything hip – from the latest clothes and gadgetry to music. Music is a big part of their lives. They like to think of themselves as always being in the know. And while they live vicariously through their gaming experiences – they would give anything to be a part of a real experience.</p>

			<h4>The Concept</h4>
			<p>Livin' It</p>

			<h4>The Solution</h4>
			<p>A deeply engaging, viral XBOX LIVE experience with the ultimate reward being – a night with the Black Eyed Peas. The experience begins with the gamer profiling themselves. Next, the gamer uploads a photo of them playing their favourite Xbox game. Then the base votes on who gets to win. The more votes their photo gets, the greater their chances of winning.

			To thank gamers for Livin’ it, they get a shot at the XBOX 360 console, backstage passes to the Black Eyed Peas concert, the opportunity to play their favourite game with the Black Eyed Peas (they’re avid gamers too) and an afternoon of paintball.</p>

		<div class="work dungeon">
			<h2>Dungeon Siege II</h2>
			<h3>Viral Game</h3>

			<h4>The Challenge</h4>
			<p>To create excitement around the launch of Dungeon SiegeII</p>

			<h4>Target</h4>
			<p>Online Games</p>

			<h4>The Insight</h4>
			<p>Gamers like to try before they buy. They read up on everything they can before they buy into a game. They are part of an extensive community of games – they’re hard core about the genre of games they play.

			Dungeon Siege was not such a great success due in large part to the lack of story telling, graphics, sound, animation. Inform gamers that Dungeon SiegeII is better than ever – and that they can experience a whole new level of blood, gore and bone-chilling drama.</p>

			<h4>The Concept</h4>
			<p>Challenge – Do you have what it takes to be the next hero of Aranna?</p>

			<h4>The Solution</h4>
			<p>A two pronged approach was developed that included a viral component.
			<ul>
				<li>Website experience where gamers could sign up to create a battle party or sign up to play on their own.</li>
				<li>An online game that closely paralleled the not-yet released Dungeon SiegeII</li>
			</ul>

			In order to get in the game, prospects would have to give up their personal information. Gamers were encouraged to create Battle Parties (teams) of 6 to simulate the Xbox LIVE experience. They all played for prizes such as electronics, XBOX 360 consoles as well as a pre-released copy of Dungeon SiegeII.

			<h2>MSN Search Challenge</h2>
			<h3>Viral Game</h3>

			<h4>The Challenge</h4>
			<p>To gain greater insight into the Gamer Profile</p>

			<h4>Target</h4>
			<p>C-level Media Executives</p>

			<h4>The Insight</h4>
			<p>Media Executives are charged with creating media plans that target, reach and engage the desired response from consumers. They need to deliver results for marketing programs and are looking for properties that can make it happen. They see themselves as visionaries.</p>

			<h4>The Concept</h4>
			<p>Visionary</p>

			<h4>The Solution</h4>
			<p>An integrated campaign that included a face-to-face meeting and an online gaming component that was built on a challenge: Will you be the next MSN Visionary? Media Executives were encouraged to get in the trivia game for their chance to win prizes. We used this pretext to profile Media Executives and gain greater understanding of their needs and challenges. A viral component was also included.

			<h2>asksanta.com</h2>
			<h3>CRM Experience</h3>

			<h4>The Challenge</h4>
			<p>To bring MSN top of mind among families as a good corporate citizen that can provide a safe and secure environment in which children can communicate, learn and grow.</p>

			<h4>Target</h4>
			<p>Families with children who want to email Santa</p>

			<h4>The Insight</h4>
			<p>Children are extremely internet savvy and view the computer as their gateway to discovering new things. It’s as natural for children to be online today as playing tag in the school yard was years ago. Children are a captive audience.</p>

			<h4>The Concept</h4>
			<p>Santa’s Village</p>

			<h4>The Solution</h4>
			<p>An online experience where children and parents could come together to email Santa their wish list, make Santa’s favourite recipes, create their own gift tags and download desktop wallpapers.</p>

		</div>
		<div class="work msn3">
			<h2>MSN World Tour</h2>
			<h3>CRM Experience</h3>

			<h4>The Challenge</h4>
			<p>To increase support the launch of MSN Desktop Search Tool and leverage it as a viable alternative to GOOGLE.</p>
			
			<h4>Target</h4>
			<p>Business and Consumers</p>

			<h4>The Insight</h4>
			<p>We want it all and want it now and we want it to be RELEVANT.</p>

			<h4>The Concept</h4>
			<p>MSN World Tour</p>

			<h4>The Solution</h4>
			<p>MSN World Tour is an online trivia game that simulates the lightning-fast and relevant search functionality that has been built into the new MSN Desktop Search Tool. The site is 160 pages deep and takes the user on a journey all over the world. The user must sign up which enables us to pre-qualify them in our database. While seeing the search functionality come to life, the user charges on from one question to the next with the ultimate goal winning a trip for two to a mystery destination. In addition to this grand prize valued at more than $15,000, participants have the opportunity to win weekly prizes including cash, luggage, electronics and more.</p>

			<h2>Kraft Foodservice</h2>
			<h3>Integrated CRM Experience</h3>

			<h4>The Challenge</h4>
			<p>To increase share of market and build affinity with existing members and prospects</p>

			<h4>Target</h4>
			<p>Canadian Foodservice Operators</p>

			<h4>The Insight</h4>
			<p>Foodservice operators are time-starved but hungry for a partner who can deliver solutions that can help them build their business. They understand that while their end product is food, being up on current dining experiences, innovative products, on-trend recipes, and customer satisfaction are just as important.</p>

			<h4>The Concept</h4>
			<p>Kraft Works</p>

			<h4>The Solution</h4>
			<p>An integrated approach to customer relationship management. Integrating both offline and online (web and email) components to enrich the experience and create affinity between Kraft Foodservice and Operators and mitigate the share of market threatened by generic foodservice companies such as Gordon Foodservice. Operators are encouraged to join the Kraft Works program to receive special offers, business building tools and expert advice from like-minded chefs.</p>

			<h2>Diageo</h2>
			<h3>CRM</h3>

			<h4>The Challenge</h4>
			<p>To increase share of throat by pre-qualifying prospects and existing program members.</p>

			<h4>Target</h4>
			<p>Existing Diageo Database</p>
			
			<h4>The Insight</h4>
			<p>When it comes to share of throat – loyalty runs high amongst adorers. There is an incredible sense of community among drinkers that is directly related to the type of alcohol they consume. For Guinness it’s being a man’s man, for Johnnie Walker it’s status and for Crown Royal it’s family. Tapping into to the emotion tied with the brand, facilitates a more deeply engaged consumer – and one that spends more.</p>

			<h4>The Concept</h4>
			<p>
				<ul>
					<li>The Guinness Perfect Match Rugby Tour</li>
					<li>The Johnnie Walker Book of Toasts</li>
					<li>The Crown Royal Gift Pack</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

			<h4>The Solution</h4>
			<p>To re-qualify the database to gain greater insight to drinking habits and lifestyle choices in order to create greater affinity with the brand.</p>

			<h2>Rogers Wireless</h2>
			<h3>CRM</h3>

			<h4>The Challenge</h4>
			<p>To mitigate attrition</p>

			<h4>Target</h4>
			<p>Rogers Wireless Customers – Youth, Family, SOHOs</p>

			<h4>The Insight</h4>
			<p>Rogers Wireless Customers want to be valued, recognized and rewarded. In their world – life happens online. They rely heavily on being connected and see themselves on the cutting edge of new and emerging technologies. If there’s a new gadget – they want to be the first to know about it and will most likely be the first to adapt it.</p>

			<h4>The Concept</h4>
			<p>The Rogers Wireless E-Newsletter</p>

			<h4>The Solution</h4>
			<p>A monthly e-newsletter packed with information, offers and news that is customized based on the consumers needs.</p>

			<h2>British Petroleum</h2>
			<h3>CRM/Anti-attrition – Integrated Program</h3>

			<h4>The Challenge</h4>
			<p>To sustain and grow the database and create brand affinity with British Petroleum – a premium brand of fuel.</p>

			<h4>Target</h4>
			<p>Business and Consumers</p>
			
			<h4>The Insight</h4>
			<p>Americans love their cars, love to drive, worship their mechanics and are loyal to BP because only the best will do. In other words, BP – a premium fuel – has a very captive, environmentally conscious customer base who believes they get what they pay for. With the rising cost of gas in the US we wanted to sustain consumer loyalty and remind consumers of the reasons why they chose BP in the first place.</p>

			<h4>The Concept</h4>
			<p>BP Ultimate Road Tour</p>

			<h4>The Solution</h4>
			<p>The BP Ultimate Road Tour is an online gaming experience that takes prospects on a scenic tour of the United States. There are three journeys they can choose from, each with three legs. Along the way, they learn about the regions, pick up fuel facts and learn about BP fuels. The ultimate prize is a trip for two to one of five destinations – a prize valued at $10,000.</p>
